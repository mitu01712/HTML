        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and also the smallest in our solar system. It has a rocky surface
         covered with craters, making it look much like our Moon. Because it has almost no atmosphere, temperatures on
          Mercury swing wildly—from extremely hot during the day (about 430°C) to freezing cold at night (about -180°C).
           Despite being so close to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet—that title goes to Venus, which has a thick
            atmosphere that traps heat. A year on Mercury is very short; it takes only 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun. Mercury
             has no moons or rings, and it doesn’t have weather like wind or rain. It also has no water on its surface. The planet
              rotates very slowly, so a single day (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days. Most of what we know about Mercury
               comes from space missions like NASA’s MESSENGER. Studying Mercury helps scientists learn more about how rocky planets form and
                survive near stars.

        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size and structure to Earth, which is why it’s often called Earth’s twin. 
        However, Venus is covered with thick clouds of poisonous gases, mainly carbon dioxide, making it extremely hot and uninhabitable. 
        It has a surface temperature of around 465°C (869°F), which makes it the hottest planet in the solar system—even hotter than Mercury.
         The thick clouds trap heat through a strong greenhouse effect. Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, 
         meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. One day on Venus (one full rotation) takes longer than its year!
          The surface has mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains, but no water. It has no moons or rings. The dense clouds also reflect sunlight,
           making Venus the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Despite its beauty, Venus is one of the most extreme 
           and hostile places in the solar system.

        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet that supports life.
         It has a mild climate, liquid water, and a protective atmosphere, which make it perfect for plants,
          animals, and humans to survive. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, mostly in oceans, and the rest is land 
          with mountains, forests, deserts, and cities. Earth has a rocky surface and a core made of iron and nickel. It takes 365.25 days
           to orbit the Sun, creating one year, and 24 hours to rotate once, which makes a day. Earth has one natural satellite—the Moon—which 
           affects tides and stabilizes its rotation. The atmosphere is rich in oxygen and nitrogen, and it protects us from harmful space 
           radiation. Earth also has weather systems, seasons, and a strong magnetic field. It is a unique planet in the solar system because 
           of its biodiversity and habitable environment.
