        The solar system is a group of objects that orbit the Sun, which is a star at the center. It includes eight planets: 
        Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets move around the Sun in oval-shaped
         paths called orbits. Earth is the only planet known to have life. Some planets have moons that orbit them. There are
          also dwarf planets like Pluto, as well as asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Most asteroids are found in the Asteroid
           Belt between Mars and Jupiter. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago. It is part of a huge galaxy called 
           the Milky Way. The Sunâ€™s gravity keeps everything in the solar system together.

            The solar system is a massive space system centered around the Sun, a giant ball of hot gases that produces light and heat. 
            It includes eight planets, over 200 moons, several dwarf planets like Pluto, and countless asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. 
            The planets orbit the Sun due to its powerful gravitational pull. Inner planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are rocky,
             while outer planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are made mostly of gas and ice. Jupiter is the largest planet,
              and Neptune is the farthest. The Asteroid Belt lies between Mars and Jupiter, while the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud are even farther, 
              full of icy bodies. The solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust.
               It moves through the Milky Way galaxy, which contains billions of other stars and planetary systems. Scientists study the solar
                system using telescopes, satellites, and space missions to explore its wonders and search for signs of life beyond Earth.
